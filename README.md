# Java DSA — Core Data Structures Implemented in Java

This repository contains implementations of core Data Structures in Java with focus on **logic**, **internal working**, and **operations**.

---

## 📂 Contents

| Data Structure | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Stack**     | Implementation of stack operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty) using Java (Array / LinkedList based) |
| **Linked List** | Implementation of singly linked list operations (insert, delete, traversal, search) |

> More Data Structures will be added continuously.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build strong fundamentals in Data Structures using **pure Java**
- Understand how each DS works internally (not just using Java Collections)
- Practice writing code that prepares for competitive coding + interviews

---

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjay-TN/Java-DSA.git
cd Java-DSA
javac *.java
java Main   # (or run specific class)
